Create a ProgramType object possessing all schedules and loads defining the usage of a space. 

ProgramTypes can be assigned to Honeybee Rooms to specify all default schedules and loads on the Room. 



#### Inputs
* ##### name 
Text to set the name for the ProgramType and to be incorporated into a unique ProgramType identifier. 
* ##### base_program 
An optional ProgramType object that will be used as the starting point for the new ProgramType output from this component. This can also be text for the name of a ProgramType within the library such as that output from the "HB Search Program Types" component. If None, a Plenum program type will be used as the base with no loads, setpoints, or ventilation requirements assigned. 
* ##### people 
A People object to describe the occupancy of the program. If None, no occupancy will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### lighting 
A Lighting object to describe the lighting usage of the program. If None, no lighting will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### electric_equip 
An ElectricEquipment object to describe the usage of electric equipment within the program. If None, no electric equipment will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### gas_equip 
A GasEquipment object to describe the usage of gas equipment within the program. If None, no gas equipment will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### hot_water 
A ServiceHotWater object to describe the usage of hot water within the program. If None, no hot water will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### infiltration 
An Infiltration object to describe the outdoor air leakage of the program. If None, no infiltration will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### ventilation 
A Ventilation object to describe the minimum outdoor air requirement of the program. If None, no ventilation requirement will be assumed for the program. (Default: None). 
* ##### setpoint 
A Setpoint object to describe the temperature and humidity setpoints of the program.  If None, the ProgramType cannot be assigned to a Room that is conditioned. (Default: None). 

#### Outputs
* ##### program
A ProgramType object that can be assigned to Honeybee Rooms in order to specify all default schedules and loads on the Room.
