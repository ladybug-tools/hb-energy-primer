Run an IDF file through EnergyPlus. 



#### Inputs
* ##### idf [Required]
Path to an IDF file as a text string. This can also be a list of IDF files. 
* ##### epw_file [Required]
The full file path to epw weather file that you would like the simulation to run with. 
* ##### parallel 
Set to "True" to run execute simulations of multiple IDF files in parallel, which can greatly increase the speed of calculation but may not be desired when other processes are running. If False, all EnergyPlus simulations will be be run on a single core. Default: False. 
* ##### run [Required]
Set to "True" to run the IDF through EnergyPlus. 
This input can also be the integer "2", which will run the whole simulation silently (without any batch windows). 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
Check here to see a report of the EnergyPlus run. 
* ##### sql
The file path of the SQL result file that has been generated on your machine. 
* ##### zsz
Path to a .csv file containing detailed zone load information recorded over the course of the design days. 
* ##### rdd
The file path of the Result Data Dictionary (.rdd) file that is generated after running the file through EnergyPlus.  This file contains all possible outputs that can be requested from the EnergyPlus model.  Use the Read Result Dictionary component to see what outputs can be requested. 
* ##### html
The HTML file path of the Summary Reports. Note that this will be None unless the input _sim_par_ denotes that an HTML report is requested and _run is set to True.
