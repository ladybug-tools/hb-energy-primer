Create a window material to describe a single glass pane corresponding to a layer in a window construction. This material can be plugged into the "HB Window Construction" component. 



#### Inputs
* ##### name 
Text to set the name for the material and to be incorporated into a unique material identifier. 
* ##### thickness [Required]
Number for the thickness of the glass layer [m]. Typical values range from 0.003 meters (3 mm) to 0.012 meters (12 mm). 
* ##### transmittance 
Number between 0 and 1 for the transmittance of both solar radiation and visible light through the glass at normal incidence. (Default: 0.85 for clear uncoated glass). 
* ##### reflectance 
Number between 0 and 1 for the reflectance of both solar radiation and visible light off of the front side of the glass at normal incidence. (Default: 0.075 for clear uncoated glass). 
* ##### t_infrared 
Long-wave transmittance of the glass at normal incidence. (Default: 0). 
* ##### emiss_front 
Number between 0 and 1 for the infrared hemispherical emissivity of the front side of the glass. (Defaul: 0.84, which is typical of clear glass). 
* ##### emiss_back 
Number between 0 and 1 for the infrared hemispherical emissivity of the back side of the glass. (Default: 0.84, which is typical of clear glass). 
* ##### conductivity 
Number for the thermal conductivity of the glass in W/m-K. (Default: 0.9, whih is typical of clear glass). 

#### Outputs
* ##### mat
A window material that describes a single glass pane and can be assigned to a Honeybee Window construction.
