Create a standard opaque material, which can be plugged into the "HB Opaque Construction" component. 



#### Inputs
* ##### name 
Text to set the name for the material and to be incorporated into a unique material identifier. 
* ##### thickness [Required]
Number for the thickness of the material layer [m]. 
* ##### conductivity [Required]
Number for the thermal conductivity of the material [W/m-K]. 
* ##### density [Required]
Number for the density of the material [kg/m3]. 
* ##### spec_heat [Required]
Number for the specific heat of the material [J/kg-K]. 
* ##### roughness 
Text describing the relative roughness of the material. Must be one of the following: 'VeryRough', 'Rough', 'MediumRough', 'MediumSmooth', 'Smooth', 'VerySmooth'. (Default: 'MediumRough'). 
* ##### therm_absp 
A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of incident long wavelength radiation that is absorbed by the material. (Default: 0.9). 
* ##### sol_absp 
A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of incident solar radiation absorbed by the material. (Default: 0.7). 
* ##### vis_absp 
A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of incident visible wavelength radiation absorbed by the material. Default value is the same as the _sol_absp_. 

#### Outputs
* ##### mat
A standard opaque material that can be assigned to a Honeybee Opaque construction.
