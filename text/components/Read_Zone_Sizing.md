Parse a zone sizing (ZSZ) csv result file from an energy simulation to get data collections for the cooling/heating load over the peak design day. 



#### Inputs
* ##### zsz [Required]
Full path to a zone sizing (ZSZ) csv result file that was generated by EnergyPlus. 

#### Outputs
* ##### cooling_load
a list of HourlyContinuousCollections for zone cooling load. There will be one data collection per conditioned zone in the model. 
* ##### heating_load
a list of HourlyContinuousCollections for zone heating load. There will be one data collection per conditioned zone in the model.
