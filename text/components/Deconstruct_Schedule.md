Deconstruct a ScheduleRuleset into an array of day-long ladybug DataCollections representing each unique ScheduleDay that defines the ScheduleRuleset. 

These DataCollections can be used to make visualizations of timeseries schedule values over each unique day of the schedule using a component like the "LB Line Chart".
